title: Shapley Value Regression with Gini
url: https://github.com/wudongjie/shapley
description: This is code for running Shapley Value Regression with Gini coefficients. After training a model, we want to learn how each predictor contributes to the model prediction. One way to tackle this problem is to use Shapley Value Regression (SVR). A conventional SVR approach applies on a linear regression model and decompose the R-square using Shapley values. This code uses Gini coefficients instead of R-square so that it can be applied to not only linear regression models but also a variety of different models such as decision tree, neural network, etc.
