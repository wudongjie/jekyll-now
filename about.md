### About me

I am a PhD student in the School of Economics. My research interests are economic inequality and health economics.

My thesis is about measuring inequality of opportunity using data from China. For the thesis, I relied on a variety of econometric models, such as the Finite Mixture Model, the Multinomial Regression Model and the Hurdle Model, to analyze the data and establish the measurement of inequality of opportunity. I also experienced in different types of data, such as household longitudinal data, administrative data from universities and health survey data.

In addition, I am interested in data science and machine learning. I have learned several online machine learning courses since 2015. I am looking forward to applying these techniques in my future career.
