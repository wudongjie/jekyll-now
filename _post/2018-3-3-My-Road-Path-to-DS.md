Recently, I started to seriously consider a career switch to Data Science (DS). I am now waiting my feedbacks of my PhD thesis and working as a casual research assistant. I have started learning machine learning and data science casually and occasionally since 2015. 

At the beginning, I found Andrew Ng's popular machine learning course on Coursera and studied for fun. However, the Alphago's games with Lee Sedol really blew my mind. I realized that this new AI stuff was going to change the whole world. So I kept exploring in this area as long as I had some spare time. Now since I was going to graduate, I started to consider a career switch and planned my future.

## My strength and weakness

Having got through my four-year PhD, I was experienced in statistical modeling and empirical analysis. I used Python, R and Stata for data analysis and visualization. My daily task basically involved modeling, analyzing data and telling stories using results from empirical analysis.

However, my work is mainly constraint in academic areas. For example, I felt I have limit knowledge of computer science, which is necessary for positions like DS.     

## My Learning Path to DS

To help myself fit this role, I decided to start learning several courses. These courses correspond to different skill sets for a data scientist.

### Computer Science

Although a data scientist might not be an expert in computer science, the knowledge of computer science is definitely needed for this role. In academic area, we pay more attention to explaining the nature of humanity and universe using theoretical models, assumptions and mathematical expressions. However, in industry, companies need those who can solve their problems (like algorithms). Just as Yuval Harari says, "The 21st century will be dominated by algorithms."

For me, although I started learning computer at an early age (e.g. I learned basic when I was 5 years old; I learned C++ when I was 17.), I never toughed algorithm. In other words, I never fully understood how to solve problems using computers.

To build a solid foundation on computer science, I decided to first take two online courses from Berkley: CS61A and CS61B. If I have some extra time, maybe I will also study CS61C.

### Machine Learning
Since I have learned several Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses, I will just review basic machine learning algorithms such as linear regression, SVM, random forest, etc. 

For deep learning, I hope to focus on one specific area: Natural Language Processing (NLP). I will take the Stanford's NLP course: CS224n, and then do several NLP projects. 

### Database and Big Data


### Interviews Preparation
